        description: <p>In 2013 The insitu team, went and explored the study of Bio-mimicry and bio-materials, whether it was possible to marry the two and create every day products. <br></br>The result was The 'My-Series' line of products. My-Series is a an innovative exploration into 'mycelium',  a mushroom based compound, which can be manipulated and cured into a solid material. <br></br>Insitu is currently still exploring the qualities and features of My-Celium and other bio-degradable material sources and they are eager to share their findings with other peoples of interest. The idea was that one day we could grow products based on what we have around us. The technology or science behind Mycelium and other eco-based materials is nothing new and has been in research since the 90's. Insitu wanted to implement the science so that it could be accessible for every day items, ultimately disrupting the very resource intensive plastic and building material industries</p>,

        description: <p>In 2013 The insitu team, went and explored the study of Bio-mimicry and bio-materials, whether it was possible to marry the two and create every day products. <br></br>The result was The 'My-Series' line of products. My-Series is a an innovative exploration into 'mycelium',  a mushroom based compound, which can be manipulated and cured into a solid material. <br></br>Insitu is currently still exploring the qualities and features of My-Celium and other bio-degradable material sources and they are eager to share their findings with other peoples of interest. The idea was that one day we could grow products based on what we have around us. The technology or science behind Mycelium and other eco-based materials is nothing new and has been in research since the 90's. Insitu wanted to implement the science so that it could be accessible for every day items, ultimately disrupting the very resource intensive plastic and building material industries</p>,

        description: <p>We analyse the past so that we can predict the future. This symbiotic relationship has forced us to put the present in our subconscious. Ultimately we are a contradiction to ourselves as we are at the crossroads of past and future. <br></br>Through the means of technology and a revolution in ways information is delivered, it has allowed us to leave less room for knowledge retention, less room for the present. The old ways of reading and retaining is long antiquated. Information is plentiful and anyone can access it, This leads us to despise the present. The present is time consuming, the present is out job, the present lacks excitement. The present is thinking when our next pay increase is. <br></br> The present is what's wrong with the past. The present is worse off than the future, the present is simply "boring". <br></br> We disagree. <br></br> We are excited to be here, we are enthusiastic about the present, like the buildings of old Europe and ancient Asia. they stand as a testament of its past glories. In the case of Australia we feel that now is the time for designers and architects to leave a mark. We are served with a blank canvas and it's up to us to paint our futures. <br></br> Confluence is the crossroads, it's to initiate an intimate space in the public realm, for you to choose an opening and reflect the possibilities we hold. We hope you enjoy it.</p>,

Given that the scope of the project required complete coordination of services for DA submission, there was constant consultant coordination and an updated critical path seout for the project.</p>,

As it is the arrival point for the clients of The Tops Conference Centre, it had a roof form that not only served a functional purpose for the forecourt and adjacent breeze ways but was also emblematic of the Tops logo to inspire achievement and drive, which is core to their business model.<br></br>The Australian vernacular, that is the verandah, was a pivotal expression for the built form given the brief required their visitors to be protected from the weather as they arrived.I led this project from Concept Design to Tender submission, and as it entered the Construction phase, I worked with the Contractor to achieve its successful completion.</p>,

The floors over the 15m height line were set back to reinforce the street building line to further articulate the building form and create a private open space on the western terrace for use by the building occupants.<br></br>I saw the project from Concept Design to Tender submission. The project was unique as it required re-writing the Local Environmental Planning Policy for this project to achieve the required building heights. To achieve this, I worked closely with the planner which gave me insight into urban planning rules and definitions.</p>,

As an artistic community Furries have an issue wherby their artwork is used and distributed without being payed for it. This is preventing these communities to create and share their creativity. This application involved using blockchain smart contracts and steganography to embed a creators stamp within the artwork and is tracked on a destributed ledger. In this case the NEAR blockchain<br></br> Challenges was working with untyped javascript, npm, non-modular js libraries. Technologies used was IPFS, React, Rust, Steganography, NEAR, Ceramic, WASM, Parcel</p>,
