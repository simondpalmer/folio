        description: <p>We analyse the past so that we can predict the future. This symbiotic relationship has forced us to put the present in our subconscious. Ultimately we are a contradiction to ourselves as we are at the crossroads of past and future. <br></br>Through the means of technology and a revolution in ways information is delivered, it has allowed us to leave less room for knowledge retention, less room for the present. The old ways of reading and retaining is long antiquated. Information is plentiful and anyone can access it, This leads us to despise the present. The present is time consuming, the present is out job, the present lacks excitement. The present is thinking when our next pay increase is. <br></br> The present is what's wrong with the past. The present is worse off than the future, the present is simply "boring". <br></br> We disagree. <br></br> We are excited to be here, we are enthusiastic about the present, like the buildings of old Europe and ancient Asia. they stand as a testament of its past glories. In the case of Australia we feel that now is the time for designers and architects to leave a mark. We are served with a blank canvas and it's up to us to paint our futures. <br></br> Confluence is the crossroads, it's to initiate an intimate space in the public realm, for you to choose an opening and reflect the possibilities we hold. We hope you enjoy it.</p>,

These towers established a new gateway and better connectivity to the Brisbane River.<br></br>At the podium level was a gym and child care centre which complemented the retail offered at the lower levels and further contributed to the activation of the site and wider precinct.<br></br>As part of a small team, I worked from Concept Design to DA submission for this project. Given that the scope of the project required complete coordination of services for DA submission, there was constant consultant coordination and an updated critical path seout for the project.</p>,

As it is the arrival point for the clients of The Tops Conference Centre, it had a roof form that not only served a functional purpose for the forecourt and adjacent breeze ways but was also emblematic of the Tops logo to inspire achievement and drive, which is core to their business model.<br></br>The Australian vernacular, that is the verandah, was a pivotal expression for the built form given the brief required their visitors to be protected from the weather as they arrived.I led this project from Concept Design to Tender submission, and as it entered the Construction phase, I worked with the Contractor to achieve its successful completion.</p>,

        description: <p>The motel included 45 suites over 6 floors with a commercial space on ground to service the needs of Crown St Surry Hills, Sydney.<br></br>To ensure the building had a positive impact on the street, the mass of the building above 15m was examined carefully. The floors over the 15m height line were set back to reinforce the street building line to further articulate the building form and create a private open space on the western terrace for use by the building occupants.<br></br>I saw the project from Concept Design to Tender submission. The project was unique as it required re-writing the Local Environmental Planning Policy for this project to achieve the required building heights. To achieve this, I worked closely with the planner which gave me insight into urban planning rules and definitions.</p>,

        description: <p>100-104 Reynolds St was a mixed-use development with 19 units, 6 professional suites and associated car parking. The ground floor was comprised of retail that opened to a forecourt to the east. Most of the units within the existing heritage building were accessed by a bridge from Reynolds Street and had lift access from the car park. Bicycle parking was provided for the residents as well as additional storage. There is retail parking provided in the basement with direct access to the retail and professional suites above.<br></br>Whilst coordinating consultants and outsourcing architectural documentation, my role was to work closely with the director from Concept Design to Tender submission. I had the opportunity to lead a small team within the office to deliver the projects milestones.</p>,
